# 🧠 Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

A web-based application built using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Flask** that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical data. This project uses the **PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset** and implements a **Logistic Regression model** to perform binary classification.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This application allows users to input medical parameters such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, etc., and predicts whether the person is likely to have diabetes. It also features a web interface using **HTML/CSS** (and optionally **Tailwind CSS**) for easy interaction.

## 🔍 Features

- Predict diabetes using a trained Logistic Regression model
- Web interface for inputting medical data
- Real-time prediction on user input
- CSV-based dataset processing
- Clean and user-friendly interface
- Flask backend for smooth deployment
